## Project Overview
An end-to-end shipment analytics report for a chocolate brand to track current-year vs past-year performance. The dashboard contains KPIs and interactive visuals to analyze:

- Total Amount (CY / PY)
- Total Boxes (CY / PY)
- Shipment Count & Distribution
- Top 6 Products (by Amount or Boxes)
- Top 6 Salespersons (by Amount or Boxes)
- Complete product list with amount and profit %

I built the ETL (Power Query), created a star-schema data model, added DAX measures for time-intelligence and KPIs, and designed a clean Power BI dashboard with filters and slicers for ad-hoc analysis.
